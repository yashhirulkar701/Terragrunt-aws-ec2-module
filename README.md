This project we will create an AWS EC2 instance using Terragrunt and Terraform. 

- This project gives you clear idea of how Terragrunt is used with terraform in different environments to avoid the Redundancy and Manual update of code.


## Tech

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
#### Terraform is a great Infrastructure as Code tool for managing your cloud infrastructure.

- [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/)
#### Terragrunt is an additional wrapper that is built on top of the Terraform. It was was built to improve the shortcomings around the Terraform for effectively managing the infrastructure code without any kind of duplication by keeping the terraform code dry
